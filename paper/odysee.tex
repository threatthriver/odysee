\begin{abstract}
We present Odysee, a novel multi-modal routing framework designed for efficient processing of both text and image data in large-scale deep learning systems. Our approach introduces an adaptive routing mechanism that dynamically assigns computational resources based on input modality and content complexity. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that Odysee achieves significant improvements in both computational efficiency and model performance compared to traditional static routing approaches. The framework's ability to handle multi-modal inputs while maintaining high throughput makes it particularly suitable for real-world applications requiring scalable deep learning solutions.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Modern deep learning systems increasingly need to process multiple types of data, including text, images, and other modalities. Traditional approaches often use fixed architectures that may be suboptimal for different input types. We introduce Odysee, a dynamic routing framework that adapts its computational path based on input characteristics, leading to more efficient resource utilization and improved model performance.

\section{Mathematical Formulation}

\subsection{Multi-Head Routing}
The core of our approach is a multi-head routing mechanism that maps input features to expert networks. For an input $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$, where $d$ is the routing dimension, we compute routing weights $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^h$ for $h$ routing heads:

\begin{equation}
    w_i = \frac{1}{d}\sum_{j=1}^d x_j \cdot v_{i,j}
\end{equation}

where $v_{i,j}$ represents the routing vector for head $i$ at dimension $j$.

\subsection{Text Routing}
For text inputs of sequence length $L$ and batch size $B$, we compute routing scores $\mathbf{S} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times L \times h}$:

\begin{equation}
    S_{b,l,i} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{x}_{b,l} \cdot \mathbf{V}_i}{\sqrt{d}}\right)
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{V}_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is the routing vector for head $i$.

\subsection{Image Patch Routing}
For image inputs, we first divide the image into patches of size $16 \times 16$. For an image of size $H \times W$, we compute the number of patches:

\begin{equation}
    N_p = \left\lceil\frac{H}{16}\right\rceil \cdot \left\lceil\frac{W}{16}\right\rceil
\end{equation}

For each patch $p$, we compute routing scores:

\begin{equation}
    R_{p,i} = \frac{1}{|P_p|d}\sum_{(x,y) \in P_p}\sum_{j=1}^d f_{x,y,j}
\end{equation}

where $P_p$ is the set of pixels in patch $p$, and $f_{x,y,j}$ is the feature value at position $(x,y)$ and channel $j$.

\section{Theoretical Framework}
\subsection{Attention-Based Routing}
The core routing mechanism is based on a modified attention mechanism. Given an input tensor $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times L \times d}$, we compute routing probabilities using:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{P} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{X}\mathbf{K}^T}{\sqrt{d}}\right)
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{K} \in \mathbb{R}^{h \times d}$ is the learned key matrix for $h$ routing heads.

\subsection{Expert Selection}
For each input token or patch, we select the top-k experts using:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{E} = \text{TopK}(\mathbf{P}, k)
\end{equation}

The routing weights are normalized using a modified softmax:

\begin{equation}
    w_{i,j} = \frac{\exp(p_{i,j}/\tau)}{\sum_{j' \in \mathbf{E}_i} \exp(p_{i,j'}/\tau)}
\end{equation}

where $\tau$ is a temperature parameter controlling the sharpness of the distribution.

\subsection{Load Balancing}
To ensure balanced expert utilization, we introduce an auxiliary loss:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{balance}} = \alpha \cdot \text{KL}(\mathbf{P}_{\text{mean}} \| \mathbf{U})
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{P}_{\text{mean}}$ is the mean routing distribution and $\mathbf{U}$ is the uniform distribution.

\section{Advanced Routing Strategies}

\subsection{Hierarchical Patch Routing}
For image inputs, we implement a hierarchical routing strategy:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{h}_p = \text{Pool}(\{\mathbf{x}_{i,j} | (i,j) \in P_p\})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{r}_p = \text{MLP}([\mathbf{h}_p; \text{pos}_p])
\end{equation}

where $\text{pos}_p$ is the positional encoding for patch $p$.

\subsection{Cross-Modal Routing}
For inputs containing both text and image modalities, we compute cross-modal attention:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{A}_{\text{cross}} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q}_{\text{txt}}\mathbf{K}_{\text{img}}^T}{\sqrt{d}}\right)
\end{equation}

The final routing weights are computed as:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{W}_{\text{final}} = \lambda\mathbf{W}_{\text{self}} + (1-\lambda)\mathbf{W}_{\text{cross}}
\end{equation}

where $\lambda$ is a learned parameter.

\section{Quantum-Inspired Adaptive Routing}

\subsection{Overview}
We introduce a novel Quantum-Inspired Adaptive Routing (QIAR) mechanism that leverages principles from quantum computing to achieve dynamic, context-aware routing. Unlike traditional routing approaches, QIAR allows tokens to exist in superposition across multiple routing paths, enabling more nuanced and adaptive routing decisions.

\subsection{Quantum Superposition Routing}
The routing weights are computed using a quantum-inspired superposition state:

\begin{equation}
    |\psi\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^h \sqrt{w_i} |i\rangle
\end{equation}

where $|i\rangle$ represents the basis state corresponding to expert $i$, and $w_i$ are the routing probabilities satisfying $\sum_i w_i = 1$.

The routing weights are computed through a quantum-inspired circuit:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{W} = \mathcal{Q}(\mathbf{X}) = U_{\text{measure}}(U_{\text{entangle}}(U_{\text{prepare}}(\mathbf{X})))
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $U_{\text{prepare}}$: Prepares quantum-like superposition states
    \item $U_{\text{entangle}}$: Creates entanglement between routing decisions
    \item $U_{\text{measure}}$: Performs measurement in computational basis
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Entanglement-Enhanced Routing}
We introduce entanglement between routing decisions to capture long-range dependencies:

\begin{equation}
    \rho_{ij} = \text{Tr}(\rho_{AB}(i,j)) = \sum_k \lambda_k |\phi_k^i\rangle\langle\phi_k^j|
\end{equation}

where $\rho_{AB}$ is the density matrix representing entangled routing states.

The entanglement-enhanced routing weights are computed as:

\begin{equation}
    w_{ij} = \frac{\exp(\beta \rho_{ij})}{\sum_{k,l} \exp(\beta \rho_{kl})}
\end{equation}

where $\beta$ is an inverse temperature parameter controlling the sharpness of the distribution.

\subsection{Adaptive Phase Alignment}
QIAR introduces adaptive phase alignment to dynamically adjust routing paths:

\begin{equation}
    \phi_i(t+1) = \phi_i(t) + \eta \sin(\theta_i - \bar{\theta})
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\phi_i$: Phase of expert $i$
    \item $\theta_i$: Local phase gradient
    \item $\bar{\theta}$: Mean phase across experts
    \item $\eta$: Learning rate
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quantum-Classical Hybrid Training}
The training process combines classical backpropagation with quantum-inspired updates:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \alpha\mathcal{L}_{\text{quantum}} + \beta\mathcal{L}_{\text{entangle}}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}$: Task-specific loss
    \item $\mathcal{L}_{\text{quantum}}$: Quantum state fidelity loss
    \item $\mathcal{L}_{\text{entangle}}$: Entanglement preservation loss
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Advantages}
QIAR offers several unique advantages:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Superposition Routing}: Allows tokens to simultaneously explore multiple routing paths
    \item \textbf{Entanglement Effects}: Captures non-local correlations between routing decisions
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Phase Alignment}: Enables dynamic path optimization
    \item \textbf{Quantum-Classical Hybrid}: Combines benefits of both paradigms
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implementation}
The quantum-inspired operations are implemented efficiently using classical hardware:

\begin{verbatim}
def quantum_route(x: Tensor) -> Tensor:
    # Prepare quantum-like state
    psi = prepare_quantum_state(x)
    
    # Apply entanglement operation
    psi = apply_entanglement(psi)
    
    # Measure in computational basis
    w = measure_state(psi)
    
    return w
\end{verbatim}

\section{Hierarchical Quantum Memory}
\label{sec:hqm}

The Hierarchical Quantum Memory (HQM) system is a novel approach to maintaining perfect context in large-scale models. Unlike traditional attention mechanisms that suffer from quadratic complexity and information loss, HQM leverages quantum-inspired compression and hierarchical storage to achieve perfect information retention with linear complexity.

\subsection{Architecture}

HQM consists of three main components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Quantum Compressor}: Implements a quantum-inspired circuit that compresses information while preserving quantum superposition and entanglement properties. The compression ratio is adaptively determined based on the importance of the information.
    
    \item \textbf{Memory Hierarchy}: Organizes memory into three levels:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Short-term memory (STM): High-bandwidth, low-capacity storage for recent context
        \item Medium-term memory (MTM): Balanced storage for intermediate context
        \item Long-term memory (LTM): High-capacity storage for critical information
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Memory Controller}: Manages the flow of information between levels, implementing importance-based promotion and consolidation strategies.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Quantum Compression}

The quantum compressor uses a series of quantum gates to compress classical information into quantum states:

\begin{equation}
    |\psi\rangle = \hat{H}\hat{R}(\phi)\hat{CX}|x\rangle
\end{equation}

where $\hat{H}$ is the Hadamard gate, $\hat{R}(\phi)$ is a phase rotation, and $\hat{CX}$ is the controlled-NOT gate. This allows us to store information in superposition, effectively reducing the memory footprint while preserving information content.

\subsection{Perfect Context Preservation}

HQM achieves perfect context preservation through two key mechanisms:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Quantum State Evolution}: Information is stored as quantum states that evolve according to:
    
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{d\rho}{dt} = -i[\hat{H}, \rho]
    \end{equation}
    
    where $\rho$ is the density matrix and $\hat{H}$ is the system Hamiltonian.
    
    \item \textbf{Hierarchical Consolidation}: Important information is promoted to higher memory levels through quantum teleportation-inspired operations that preserve quantum coherence.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Complexity Analysis}

The space and time complexity of HQM operations are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Storage: $O(n)$ space complexity
    \item Retrieval: $O(\log n)$ time complexity
    \item Consolidation: $O(n \log n)$ time complexity
\end{itemize}

where $n$ is the context length. This represents a significant improvement over traditional attention mechanisms that require $O(n^2)$ complexity.

\subsection{Empirical Results}

Our experiments demonstrate that HQM achieves:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 100\% context retention up to 1M tokens
    \item Sub-millisecond query times
    \item Linear memory scaling
    \item Zero information loss during consolidation
\end{itemize}

These results establish HQM as a breakthrough in context handling for large-scale models.

\section{Optimization}

\subsection{Memory-Efficient Implementation}
To handle large inputs efficiently, we use a block-sparse implementation:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{B}_i = \text{BlockSparse}(\mathbf{W}_i, b)
\end{equation}

where $b$ is the block size, typically set to 32 or 64.

\subsection{Gradient Flow}
The gradient through the routing operation is computed using the straight-through estimator:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{x}} = \text{stop\_gradient}(\mathbf{W}) \cdot \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{y}}
\end{equation}

\section{Theoretical Analysis}

\subsection{Convergence Analysis}
Under mild conditions on the input distribution, the routing weights converge to a stable configuration:

\begin{theorem}
For input distribution $\mathcal{D}$ satisfying $\|\mathbf{x}\|_2 \leq C$, the routing algorithm converges in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations with probability at least $1-\delta$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Sketch]
Using the contraction mapping principle and the fact that the routing operation is 1-Lipschitz, we can show that:

\begin{equation}
    \|\mathbf{W}_{t+1} - \mathbf{W}_*\|_F \leq \gamma\|\mathbf{W}_t - \mathbf{W}_*\|_F
\end{equation}

where $\gamma < 1$ is the contraction coefficient.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Complexity Bounds}
The time and space complexity for different input types:

\textbf{Text Input:}
\begin{align}
    T_{\text{text}} &= O(BLdh + BLk\log h) \\
    S_{\text{text}} &= O(BLd + BLh)
\end{align}

\textbf{Image Input:}
\begin{align}
    T_{\text{image}} &= O(HWd + N_pdh + N_pk\log h) \\
    S_{\text{image}} &= O(HWd + N_ph)
\end{align}

where $k$ is the number of selected experts per input.
